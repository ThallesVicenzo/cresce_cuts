Hello! This is my version of **Cresce_Cuts**, and I gave it my all to complete it within the given time frame.

To run the application on your device, I have provided an APK in the repository.

I tried to stay as close as possible to the initial idea to make testing straightforward. Let's dive in!

### App Walkthrough

- **Initial Listing Screen:** On the initial screen, you can click on "Register Discount" to populate the discount list (this screen starts with no data).

- **Register Discount:** When you click on "Register Discount," a dialog will appear asking you to choose the type of discount.

- **Return to Home:** After registering a new product, you will be redirected to the home screen. Scroll up to refresh the data, and it should appear something like this: (Note: The activation switch will only be enabled if the date is within the valid range.)

- **View Discount:** After this, the "View Discount" button will appear, and upon clicking it, the discount details screen will be displayed.
